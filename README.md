# RFID-Based-Access-Control-using-8051

Designed and built an RFID-based access control system using the 8051 microcontroller. The system reads the RFID card number using the EM-18 RFID module and sends it to the microcontroller via UART protocol. The received number is shown on a 16x2 LCD (operated in 4-bit mode).

If the RFID number matches one of the authorized values stored in the program, a "Welcome" message is displayed; otherwise, it shows "Access Denied." The microcontroller was programmed in C.

This project demonstrates basic embedded system design, serial communication, and user interface integration.
